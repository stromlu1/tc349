        	<h3> Biography </h3>
            <p> Born on September 3rd, 1991 in Adrian, MI, I spent the entirety of my childhood growing up in the small town of Onsted, MI just 15 minutes from Adrian in Lenawee County. From an early age I had an extensive vocabulary and was often praised for being extremely well behaved in school. My interest in computers and computer related systems began around the age of thirteen when I built my first desktop computer from scratch (with the help of my uncle in picking out compatible parts to ensure that my creation would actually work.)</p> 
            <p>During my High School career I was involved in many extracurricular activities and accumulated many awards. I was in the marching and concert bands as a percussionist from 6th grade until just after my Junior year of High School. I also played baseball and basketball all four years, as well as playing football my senior year. As a baseball player I earned the most improved player award as a pitcher and third baseman, described as a "bulldog" by coaches and teammates when describing my work ethic. As a student athlete I was awarded the scholar athlete award nine times (one for each semester I played a sport.)</p> 
            <p>I was also a member of the Onsted Academic Club and a member of the National Honors Society. After graduating High School, I was able to secure a summer internship at a nearby automotive stamping plant. While I started as an intern in the quality control department I soon got re-assigned to the IT department as I had originally been hoping to intern in IT.</p>
            <p> Entering my Freshman year at MSU I struggled mightily to adjust, finishing Freshman year on final probation after going through an appeals process to prove I was dedicated to raising my GPA. The past two years I have raised my GPA back to 2.55. </p>
