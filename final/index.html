        	<h3> Introduction </h3>
            <p> My name is Lucas Bradley Strom, and I am a Junior a Michigan State University. I am currently studying Media and Information and working towards obtaining a specialization in IT.  </p>
            <h3> Hobbies and Interests</h3>
            <p> My list of Interests is quite extensive, so I will just give the basic "what, and why" explanation for some of my favorites. First and foremost, is Baseball. I have played baseball ever since I can remember and if I had the talent would have loved nothing more than to play as a profession. That being said, I still hope to find a way into managing a team eventually. Second, is playing musical instruments. Growing up on the rock and roll of the 1990s I took an immense interest in guitar and kit drums and enjoy trying to learn to play in my spare time. I also thoroughly enjoy building and/or fixing computers and learning about networking and network management. This is the reason I am studying for my bachelor's degree in Media and Information here at MSU.</p>
            <h3> Some Other Favorites </h3>
            <p> As a college student I am a big fan of food, music, and movies. The following are just a few of my favorites from each category. Food: shrimp (always cooked, but in a large variety of dishes), bacon (does ANYONE not love bacon?), and steak. Music: Metallica, Bullet for My Valentine, Van Halen, etc. Movies: Pulp Fiction, Saving Private Ryan, The Lord of The Rings series, Troy, This is The End.</p>
